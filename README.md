### Key Features
**1. Ease-of-Use**
-----So easy a caveman can do it. Simply, click the microphone icon and allow mic access.
From there, state your request and wait for result.
That’s it! You just JAB’d it!


**2. Simple, Elegant UI**
-----Complementary colors for an eye-pleasing aesthetic
Set against a white page for spaciousness and clarity when results are displayed

**3. Streamlined UX**
-----One-button operation of app (simply, click mic and talk)
One input where request is displayed for user
One amazing project (definitely worthy of at least an A+)

**4. A Modular Concept (Shoes we can grow into)**
-----Currently, only 4 APIs are being used, but as they are added and refined, JABit! can become a more useful and more robust app
Could be made into the next “Ok Google” or “Alexa”

### How JABit! Works

**Speech Recognition**
-----JABit’s speech recognition is powered by a built-in jQuery function
The function simply captures audio and transcribes it into text

**Search**
-----The text is then stored as a string
Then, the string is referenced by one of the JABit APIs (either Google Custom Search, Weather, etc.)

**Specialized Search Functions**
-----Weather (opens a customized result relevant to users location)
How does it work?
Get Location (using MapQuest Geocode API)
Grab location and pass it into Weather API
Display user’s local weather
